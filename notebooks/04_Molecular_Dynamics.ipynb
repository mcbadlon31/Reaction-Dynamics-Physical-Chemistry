    "## PROJECT SCENARIO\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a physicist at an aerospace defense laboratory. Your team is developing a next-generation **chemical laser** for directed-energy applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge**: Classic HF/DF chemical lasers use the reaction:\n",
    "$$ \\text{F} + \\text{H}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{HF}^* + \\text{H} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The laser requires HF molecules in highly excited vibrational states (v' = 2-4) to achieve **population inversion**. But:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Only 30% of product molecules are in the right vibrational states!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission:\n",
    "1. **Understand** how potential energy surfaces (PES) control product energy distribution\n",
    "2. **Analyze** molecular beam experiments to map the reaction dynamics\n",
    "3. **Apply** Polanyi's Rules to predict how to maximize vibrational excitation\n",
    "4. **Optimize** reactant conditions (velocity, vibrational state) for maximum laser efficiency\n",
    "5. **Design** the optimal chemical laser system\n",

    "- [ ] Interpret molecular beam scattering experiments and differential cross-sections\n",
    "- [ ] Visualize and analyze potential energy surfaces (PES)\n",
    "- [ ] Apply Polanyi's Rules to predict energy partitioning in products\n",

    "### PRE-LAB QUESTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: Your molecular beam experiment shows products scattered mostly in the forward direction (θ ≈ 0°). What does this tell you?\n",
    "- A) The reaction involves a long-lived complex\n",
    "- B) The reaction is a direct \"stripping\" mechanism\n",
    "- C) The products have low kinetic energy\n",
    "- D) The reaction is endothermic\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><strong>Click to reveal answer</strong></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: B) The reaction is a direct \"stripping\" mechanism**\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward scattering indicates the incoming atom \"strips\" the target atom as it flies past - a direct, fast reaction. The complex continues moving forward with little deflection. If a long-lived complex formed, it would rotate randomly before breaking apart, giving symmetric scattering in all directions.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: The F + H₂ reaction has an \"early\" barrier on the PES (barrier in the entrance channel). According to Polanyi's Rules, which type of energy is most effective?\n",
    "- A) Translational energy (fast-moving F atoms)\n",
    "- B) Vibrational energy (excited H₂ molecules)\n",
    "- C) Rotational energy\n",
    "- D) Temperature doesn't matter\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><strong>Click to reveal answer</strong></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: A) Translational energy (fast-moving F atoms)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Early barriers are located in the entrance channel before the \"turn\" on the PES. Translational energy (velocity along the reaction coordinate) is most effective at crossing early barriers. Vibrational energy is perpendicular to the reaction coordinate at this point and doesn't help much. For late barriers (exit channel), vibrational energy becomes more effective.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3**: For a chemical laser, you want HF produced in high vibrational states (v' = 3-4). The F + H₂ PES is \"attractive\" (releases energy as HF forms). Where does this energy go?\n",
    "- A) Product translation (fast-moving HF)\n",
    "- B) Product vibration (excited HF*)\n",
    "- C) Heat\n",
    "- D) Equally distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><strong>Click to reveal answer</strong></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: B) Product vibration (excited HF*)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Attractive surfaces have early barriers and release energy during bond formation in the exit channel. This energy \"whips\" the new bond into vibration, like cracking a whip. This is PERFECT for chemical lasers, which need vibrationally excited products for population inversion! Repulsive surfaces (late barriers) put energy into translation instead.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",

    "### YOUR CHALLENGE\n",

    "**Initial Data**: Three candidate reactions for your laser system:\n",
    "- **Reaction A**: F + H₂ → HF + H (classic HF laser)\n",
    "- **Reaction B**: F + D₂ → DF + D (deuterium variant)\n",
    "- **Reaction C**: Cl + HBr → HCl + Br (alternative chemistry)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make a prediction**:\n",
    "- Which reaction will produce the most vibrationally excited products?\n",
    "- How would you optimize the beam velocities?\n",
    "- What scattering pattern would you expect?\n",

    "## 1. Introduction: The Microscopic View\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical kinetics averages over billions of molecules. **Molecular reaction dynamics** looks at individual collision events. It asks: what happens when two specific molecules collide with a specific energy and orientation?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "1.  **Molecular Beams**: Experimental technique to study single collisions without interference from bulk gas.\n",
    "2.  **Potential Energy Surfaces (PES)**: The \"landscape\" of energy that dictates how atoms move.\n",
    "3.  **Trajectories**: The path a reaction takes on the PES.\n",
    "\n",
    "For chemical lasers:\n",
    "- **Population inversion** requires ≥30% of products in v' = 2-4\n",
    "- PES topology determines where energy goes (vibration vs translation)\n",
    "- Molecular beam control optimizes this distribution"

    "\n",
    "1. **Real-World Applications**: Where else are these principles used?\n",
    "   - Catalytic surface design (controlling product selectivity)\n",
    "   - Atmospheric chemistry (ozone layer dynamics)\n",
    "   - Combustion optimization (rocket engines)\n",
    "   - Plasma processing (semiconductor manufacturing)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limitations**: When does classical trajectory fail?\n",
    "   - Quantum effects (tunneling, zero-point energy)\n",
    "   - Non-adiabatic transitions (electronic state changes)\n",
    "   - Very low temperatures (quantum scattering)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Connection to Next Topics**: How does this relate to electron transfer (Notebook 05)?\n",
    "   - ET also has PES (Marcus theory)\n",
    "   - But the \"particle\" tunneling is an electron, not a nucleus!\n",
    "   - Inverted region is a quantum effect absent in classical dynamics\n",
