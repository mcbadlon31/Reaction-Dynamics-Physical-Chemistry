    "\n",
    "You're a medicinal chemist at PharmaTech Solutions. Your team developed a potent anticancer drug, but it has a critical problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The drug is TOO reactive! It degrades before reaching tumor cells.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Design a **prodrug** - an inactive precursor that converts to the active drug *at the right rate*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your challenge:**\n",
    "- **Too slow** → No therapeutic effect (t½ > 24 hours)\n",
    "- **Too fast** → Systemic toxicity (t½ < 30 minutes)\n",
    "- **Just right** → Target: t½ = 2-4 hours at body pH and temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission:\n",
    "1. **Understand** the activation barrier using Transition-State Theory\n",
    "2. **Measure** activation parameters (ΔH‡, ΔS‡) from experimental data\n",
    "3. **Elucidate** the mechanism using Kinetic Isotope Effects\n",
    "4. **Optimize** the molecular structure using Hammett analysis\n",
    "5. **Recommend** the best prodrug candidate for clinical trials\n",

    "By the end of this project notebook, you will be able to:\n",

    "### PRE-LAB QUESTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: Your prodrug has ΔH‡ = 80 kJ/mol and ΔS‡ = -50 J/(K·mol). What does the negative entropy tell you?\n",
    "- A) The reaction is very fast\n",
    "- B) The transition state is more ordered than reactants\n",
    "- C) The reaction requires a catalyst\n",
    "- D) The reaction is endothermic\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><strong>Click to reveal answer</strong></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: B) The transition state is more ordered than reactants**\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative ΔS‡ means the system loses entropy (freedom) when forming the transition state. This typically happens in associative reactions where two molecules come together, or when the transition state has a tight, rigid geometry. This \"order tax\" makes the reaction slower than entropy-neutral reactions with the same ΔH‡.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: You measure kH/kD = 6.5 at 25°C for your prodrug activation. What does this tell you?\n",
    "- A) Deuterium makes the drug more stable\n",
    "- B) Hydrogen transfer occurs in the rate-limiting step\n",
    "- C) The reaction involves quantum tunneling\n",
    "- D) Both A and B\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><strong>Click to reveal answer</strong></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: D) Both A and B**\n",
    "\n",
    "A KIE of ~6-7 is close to the theoretical maximum for classical (non-tunneling) reactions and indicates:\n",
    "1. C-H/C-D bond breaking is involved in the rate-limiting step\n",
    "2. Replacing H with D raises the activation barrier (due to lower zero-point energy)\n",
    "3. This can be used to stabilize prodrugs by deuteration!\n",
    "\n",
    "If kH/kD >> 7, quantum tunneling would be suspected.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3**: Using Hammett analysis, you find that electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) on the benzene ring speed up prodrug activation (ρ > 0). What does this tell you about the transition state?\n",
    "- A) The transition state has positive charge buildup\n",
    "- B) The transition state has negative charge buildup\n",
    "- C) The reaction is diffusion-controlled\n",
    "- D) The reaction involves free radicals\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><strong>Click to reveal answer</strong></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: B) The transition state has negative charge buildup**\n",
    "\n",
    "If EWGs accelerate the reaction (ρ > 0), it means they stabilize the transition state. EWGs stabilize negative charge, so the transition state must be developing negative charge (e.g., nucleophilic attack). Conversely, ρ < 0 would indicate positive charge buildup (electrophilic attack).\n",

    "## 1. Introduction: The Activated Complex\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision theory is intuitive but hard to calculate (steric factors are empirical). **Transition-State Theory (TST)**, developed by Eyring, Evans, and Polanyi (1930s), takes a different approach. It focuses on the species at the top of the energy barrier: the **activated complex** or **transition state** ($C^\\ddagger$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Assumptions\n",
    "1.  **Quasi-Equilibrium**: Reactants A and B are in equilibrium with the activated complex $C^\\ddagger$.\n",
    "    $$ A + B \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\overset{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} C^\\ddagger \\xrightarrow{k^\\ddagger} P $$\n",
    "2.  **Motion along Reaction Coordinate**: The complex falls apart into products with a frequency $\\nu^\\ddagger$ (a \"loose vibration\").\n",
    "\n",
    "![Reaction Coordinate](images/reaction_coordinate_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For prodrug design, this means we can:\n",
    "- **Tune the barrier height** (ΔG‡) to control reaction rate\n",
    "- **Engineer the transition state** structure to achieve desired kinetics\n",
    "- **Predict how modifications** will affect activation rate"
