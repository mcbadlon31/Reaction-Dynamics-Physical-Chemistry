Understand the molecular-level factors controlling reaction rate\n2. Analyze experimental data and compare with collision theory predictions\n3. Optimize reactor conditions (temperature, pressure) to maximize rate while minimizing cost\n4. Investigate why some reactions are faster than collision theory predicts\n\nBy the end of this project, you'll deliver a **reactor design proposal** with justified operating conditions.\n\n---\n\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n\nBy the end of this project notebook, you will be able to:\n- [ ] Calculate collision frequencies and collision densities for gas-phase molecules\n- [ ] Analyze Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions to predict reactive fractions\n- [ ] Compare theoretical pre-exponential factors with experimental data\n- [ ] Explain the \"Harpoon Mechanism\" for electron transfer reactions\n- [ ] Apply collision theory to optimize real reactor operating conditions\n- [ ] Evaluate the limitations of collision theory using real data\n\n**Self-Assessment**: Check off each objective as you complete it!\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 1: DISCOVER 🔍\n\nBefore diving into the theory, let's probe your intuition about molecular collisions.\n\n### PRE-LAB QUESTIONS\n\nThink about these questions and write down your predictions. We'll test them throughout this project.\n\n**Question 1**: At room temperature (300 K), molecules are moving at hundreds of meters per second. If every collision led to a reaction, how fast would reactions be?\n- A) Very slow (seconds to minutes)\n- B) Moderate (milliseconds)\n- C) Extremely fast (nanoseconds or faster)\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Click to reveal answer</strong></summary>\n\n**Answer: C) Extremely fast**\n\nMolecules collide billions of times per second! If every collision reacted, reactions would be essentially instantaneous. The fact that most reactions are much slower tells us that something else (energy, orientation) limits reactivity.\n</details>\n\n**Question 2**: You double the temperature from 300 K to 600 K. By approximately what factor does the collision rate change?\n- A) Stays about the same\n- B) Doubles\n- C) Increases by √2 ≈ 1.4×\n- D) Quadruples\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Click to reveal answer</strong></summary>\n\n**Answer: C) Increases by √2 ≈ 1.4×**\n\nThe mean molecular speed depends on $\\sqrt{T}$, so doubling temperature only increases collision rate by $\\sqrt{2}$. But reaction rates often increase by 100× or more! This tells us that *energy distribution*, not just collision frequency, is crucial.\n</details>\n\n**Question 3**: The K + Br₂ → KBr + Br reaction occurs 50× faster than predicted by the size of the molecules. What might explain this?\n- A) Molecules shrink when hot\n- B) Long-range forces pull molecules together before they physically touch\n- C) The reaction violates collision theory\n- D) Measurement error\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Click to reveal answer</strong></summary>\n\n**Answer: B) Long-range forces pull molecules together**\n\nThis is the **harpoon mechanism**! We'll explore this in detail later. Electron transfer creates ions that attract via Coulomb forces, creating an effective cross-section much larger than the physical size.\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### YOUR CHALLENGE\n\n**Make a prediction**: For the F + H₂ reaction at 300 K, estimate the rate constant if:\n- Collision cross-section σ ≈ 0.30 nm²\n- Every collision with the right orientation leads to reaction\n\nWrite your prediction here (in your notes):\n- Predicted k ≈ _______ M⁻¹s⁻¹\n\n**We'll test your prediction against theory AND experimental data throughout this notebook!**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction to Reaction Dynamics\n\nChemical kinetics tells us *how fast* a reaction occurs (the rate constant, $k$). **Reaction dynamics** asks *why* it occurs at that rate and *how* the individual molecular events unfold. It bridges the gap between the macroscopic world of bulk concentrations and the microscopic world of molecular collisions and energy transfer.\n\nIn this notebook, we explore **Collision Theory**, the most fundamental model for understanding gas-phase reactions. The core idea is simple: for a reaction to occur, molecules must satisfy three conditions:\n\n1.  **Collision**: They must hit each other (obviously!).\n2.  **Energy**: They must collide with enough kinetic energy to break bonds ($E \\ge E_a$).\n3.  **Orientation**: They must collide with the correct geometry (steric requirement).\n\nLet's build understanding step by step through hands-on analysis."
